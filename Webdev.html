For me and experience html is the easiest way to develop a website with a simple content and remarkable elements I can say that anyone have a skill to fit in developing a website. Web Developing using html is a simple, but the challenge will begin in terms in CSS or cascading and JS or java script for the style and design and to the Function of the web. Web developing using html has three (3) main parts, which is html, head and body tags and creating a web was divided in three major parts also, it is HTML, CSS, and JS. Html is focusing in the structure of the website; it is responsible to the content of the website. CSS is responsible to the design, line-up and the beauty of the website, lastly JS. Is the one of the responsible to the functionality of some elements or structure of the website.

Web developing will made it us to advance in technology all we need to do is to cherish it and learned it</span></p>
