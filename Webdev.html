            WHAT IS WEB DEVELOPMENT IN YOUR OWN WORDS?
          </h4>
          <p>
            ● <span>Web development is a large-scale topic that helps us to improve our technology experience, the most common and popular in developing of website is "html" or hypertext mark-up language from the word itself mark-up language, html is thot a programming language because html is designed to create a website using a specific elements and logic is not must unlike to other programming language such as java, python, etc... For me and experience html is the easiest way to develop a website with a simple content and remarkable elements I can say that anyone have a skill to fit in developing a website. Web Developing using html is a simple, but the challenge will begin in terms in CSS or cascading and JS or java script for the style and design and to the Function of the web. Web developing using html has three (3) main parts, which is html, head and body tags and creating a web was divided in three major parts also, it is HTML, CSS, and JS. Html is focusing in the structure of the website; it is responsible to the content of the website. CSS is responsible to the design, line-up and the beauty of the website, lastly JS. Is the one of the responsible to the functionality of some elements or structure of the website. It also has a side major part that is PHP, it is responsible to the database or it can be a simple JS or a functionality of the website. Web developing will made it us to advance in technology all we need to do is to cherish it and learned it</span></p>
